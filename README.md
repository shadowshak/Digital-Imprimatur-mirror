# Digital Declaration of Conformity #

## Why is this needed? ##
The Catholic Churchâ€™s existing Imprimatur process, which has existed for thousands of years, utilizes inefficient physical and paper methods and no digital technology. In modern times, the internet is the most accessible tool used for access books which therefore the church must think about.  As a result:
- The review process takes over 9 months per work, and
- There is no way to verify the integrity of a work once it is approved
This product will allow a church authority to manage the Imprimatur process digitally in a time-effective way.  Once approved and given a digital Imprimatur, a work cannot be digitally altered without losing the Imprimatur.  

Our project will provide a way to collect and store documents for review, automate the review process, allow human in-the-loop intervention, provide a user friendly interface, a secure digital stamp of approval, provide adequate cybersecurity to block hackers or embedded nefarious content, and lock down the final digital version.

## Our Deliverables ##
- General User: Front end UI for publisher to allow ability for users to submit documents for review
- Diocese User: Interface for verification offices to review submitted documents
- Use tools to automate the review process (e.g., Workflow) by Diocese that provides a report of findings. Record the trail of reviewers and results.
- Allow for manual inspection of the submitted article
- All for the addition of a Digital Imprimatur in the document (and automatically lock down the document), and its appearance in product
- Add function to store the document, and provide sender a copy
- Way for end consumers to verify the Imprimatur and authenticity of document
