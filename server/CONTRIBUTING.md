# Contributing

## Branches

All changes should be pushed to the `develop` branch. The `main` branch will be used for production level code. Development should be done in a feature branch of a fork of the repository.

## Pull Requests

When a feature is in a semi-stable condition, a pull request should be created merging the changes. A Code Review should be performed by at least one other member of the team before the pull request is approved. The pull request will also need to pass the test suite before it can be merged.

## Tests

Tests should be added to code as it is written. By the time a pull request is created, the code should be fully self-testing.
